/*
Second ORDER DERIVATIVE CALCULATION BY FIRST AND SECOND 
ORDER NUMERICAL MODELS
* drv1l and drv1r are f(x) function first order derivative values calculated
by the first order numerical model for the left and right sides from
x point respectively
*drv2a and drv2b are f(x) function second order derivative values 
calcualted by the first and second order numerical models respectively
* deriv(x) is the analytic expression for the mentioned derivative
* diff1 and diff2 are the differences between second order derivative value
 given by  analytic formula [by deriv(x)] and values coming from the first
  and the second order numerical models for second order derivative
   respectively (values of drv2a and drv2b respectively)
* rl is the ratio of dxr to dxl where dxl and dxr are used for calculation
of drv1l and drv1r respectively
